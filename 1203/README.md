# December 3, 2024 Advent of Code Problems

The problems are described in detail [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3). 
To run any of the code below, download the "`input`" data provided on the 
advent of code website as `input.txt` in the `1203` subdirectory.

***Note**: this step is manual because the input data is different for different users.*

## C++

### Problem 1

To compile and run on macos with llvm / clang:

```sh
clang++ -std=c++17 1203/solution1.cpp -o 1203/solution1.out
./1203/solution1.out
```

[*Replace `clang++ -std=c++17` with `g++ -std=gnu++17` to compile and run on linux with gcc.*]

### Problem 2

To compile and run on macos with llvm / clang:

```sh
clang++ -std=c++17 1203/solution2.cpp -o 1203/solution2.out
./1203/solution2.out
```

[*Replace `clang++ -std=c++17` with `g++ -std=gnu++17` to compile and run on linux with gcc.*]
